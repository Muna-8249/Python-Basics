        "   - Pyhhon is a high level programming language that is widely use in web application,software development, data science and machine learning. Developer use python for creating interaction for a computer to follow.\n",

        "    i)Easy to learn and use\n",

        "  - Implicit and Explicit type casting are both involve in changing a variable data types to anather. In Implicit type casting system automatically converts a value from one data type to another without losses of information.While Explicit type casting converts avalue using a cast operator by the developer(like-int, float, str etc).\n",

Python ckecks the conditions top to bottom, as soon as one condition is True , it execute that block and skip the rest. If all the conditions are False the optional else block will be executed."
